            Obviously, I love to code you must have known by now. <br />
            <br />
            Other than that, I love watching movies and sports. <br />
            <br />
            And who doesnâ€™t love playing video games... :)

            When not in front of a screen, you can find me either reading books,
            working out or meditating <br />
            <br />
            Or maybe I'm out in search of a bakery with some delicious desserts
            :p
